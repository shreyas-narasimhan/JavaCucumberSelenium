# JavaCucumberSelenium
## This is a sample automation testing framework using Java, Maven, Selenium, Cucumber, and TestNG.

## Java
Java is used as the programming language to write test scripts,
step definitions, and core framework logic.

## Maven
Maven is used as the build and dependency management tool.
It helps in maintaining consistency across environments
by using the pom.xml file to define dependencies, plugins,
and test execution configurations.
Maven also manages project structure and automates test execution.

## Selenium
Selenium is used for browser automation to interact with web elements,
perform actions such as click, type, submit, and validate UI behavior
across different browsers.

## Cucumber
Cucumber is used for Behavior Driven Development (BDD),
allowing test cases to be written in simple English using Gherkin syntax.
In this project, the Gherkin feature file is written as a
single end-to-end flow, starting from user login and continuing through
product selection, cart validation, and checkout within the same session.
This approach validates the complete user journey in one continuous scenario.

## TestNG
TestNG is used as the test runner and assertion framework,
responsible for executing test cases, managing the test lifecycle,
supporting annotations, grouping, parallel execution,
and generating detailed test reports.
